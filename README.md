## Motivation

I was inspired to choose this resume template because of its simple and clear design, with well-organized sections that make it easy to read and understand. This makes the template an ideal choice for updating and creating my resume.

By adapting this template, I can add a personal touch and effectively reflect my own identity while maintaining the organization and clarity of the information. This will help ensure that my resume stands out and presents a professional image.
It has the following features:

1.  Write with React, Next, Tailwind.
2.  The design is optimized for responsiveness and interactivity.
3.  Dark/Light Mode.
